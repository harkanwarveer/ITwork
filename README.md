# README

## Project Overview

This project consists of three main files: `start_page.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. Together, these files create a simple webpage with a structured layout, styled components, and basic interactive features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Files

### 1. start_page.html

This is the main HTML file that defines the structure and content of the webpage.

- **DOCTYPE and Metadata**: Specifies the HTML5 document type and includes metadata such as character set and title.
- **External Resources**: Links to external CSS (`style.css`) and JavaScript (`script.js`) files and Google Fonts for custom typography.
- **Header**: Contains a site-wide header with a main heading.
- **Navigation**: A navigation bar with links to different sections of the website and a search form.
- **Main Content**: Includes an article with headings, paragraphs, and subsections, as well as an aside section for related links.
- **Footer**: A footer that spans across all pages with copyright information.

### 2. style.css

This file provides the styling for the HTML elements, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.

- **Root Variables**: Defines custom properties (CSS variables) for colors and other reusable values.
- **Body Styling**: Sets the overall background color, text color, maximum width, and font family for the page.
- **Header and Footer**: Styles the header and footer with background colors, text alignment, and padding.
- **Main Content**: Applies styles to the main content area, including the article and aside sections.
- **Links and Navigation**: Customizes the appearance of links in articles and the navigation bar, including hover effects.
- **Section Styling**: Adds borders, padding, and margins to article subsections and headings.

### 3. script.js

This file adds interactivity to the webpage through JavaScript.

- **Event Listeners**: Adds event listeners to handle form submissions and link clicks.
  - Prevents the default form submission behavior and displays an alert with the search query.
  - Logs messages to the console when navigation or aside links are clicked.
  - Displays an alert when aside links are clicked, preventing their default action.
- **Utility Functions**: Includes functions to change background colors and display the current date.
- **Initialization**: Calls functions to set initial styles and content, such as changing the header background color and displaying the current date.

## How to Use

1. **Download Files**: Ensure you have all three files (`start_page.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`) in the same directory.
2. **Open HTML File**: Open `start_page.html` in a web browser to view the webpage.
3. **Interact**: Use the navigation links, search form, and other interactive elements to explore the features implemented through CSS and JavaScript.

## Customization

- **HTML Content**: Modify `start_page.html` to change the content of the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, and links.
- **CSS Styles**: Edit `style.css` to update colors, fonts, layouts, and other styling aspects to match your design preferences.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Adjust `script.js` to add new interactive features or modify existing ones based on your requirements.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic but functional webpage created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes structured content, customized styles, and interactive elements, making it a great starting point for further web development projects.
